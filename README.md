# Monks of Style

This is the monorepo for the Monks of Style project, a typesafe css-in-gleam
implementation generated from the [css-tree](https://github.com/csstree) css
grammar.

You probably want the end-user project in [monks_of_style](./monks_of_style/),
but if you are interested in tweaking the generator itself it lives in
[monks_of_style_generator](/monks_of_style/).

There is also an [example](./example/) project.
